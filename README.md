# sqlalchemy-challenge

Congratulations! 
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task!

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, Python and SQLAlchemy are used to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of the provided climate database. 
Specifically, SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used.


Part 2: Design Your Climate App
A Flask API is designed based on the queries developed in part on1. 
Flask is used to create the following routes:

/api/v1.0/precipitation

/api/v1.0/stations

/api/v1.0/tobs

/api/v1.0/start (date format: YYYY-MM-DD)

/api/v1.0/start/end (date format: YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD)
